# Simple CRUD ToDo with JavaScript
A simple To Do list, using basic design with bootstrap and css. My intention with this was to familiarize myself with using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM, save and retrieve data, etc.

## Design Pattern
The code is organized with the MVC (Mode-View-Controller) design pattern ❤️

## How it works?
To create a task, it is mandatory to provide a name, which is validated before submission. To view the task description, simply click on the task name.
